COMING SOON: This repository will contain the code for the SARLE method
I developed to automatically extract structured labels from radiology reports.

The SARLE method is described here:

Draelos et al. Machine-Learning-Based Multiple Abnormality Prediction with
Large-Scale Chest Computed Tomography Volumes.
https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/2002/2002.04752.pdf
Accepted for publication in Medical Image Analysis (2020).

## Usage

The SARLE method can be run using the Singularity container defined here:
